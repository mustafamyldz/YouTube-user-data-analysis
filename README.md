This is a python project that;

1: Pulls youtube watch history, likes and subscriptions using an API token and client secrets.
2: Visualizes the data to give a brief understanding.
3: Uses clustering, ML and statistical analyses to find significant correlations and meaninguful connections spesifically for my data.
4: Reaches a hypothesis and tests it.

You can run the program yourself, get your youtube api token into a config.txt and download the clientsecret.json from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials.

Then run API_Requests, LikeAPI, SubAPI, data_cleanup and now you're free to use any script you like for your data.csv
